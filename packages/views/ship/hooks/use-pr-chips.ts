// Phase 3 — smart action chips on a PR card.
//
// Given a PR's derived state (state, ci_status, review_decision, mergeable,
// timestamps), `derivePrChips` returns an ORDERED list of chip descriptors.
// The card renders at most the first 1–2; remaining chips overflow into a
// secondary menu. Order matters because the most actionable chip should
// always be first — the priority rules below mirror the spec in
// ROA-139.
//
// Why a derivation function rather than a Zustand selector or a server-
// supplied list?
//   - Pure: no React or Query dependencies, trivially testable.
//   - Workspace-policy free: a PR's state is the only input. The card already
//     receives the PR via TanStack Query; rendering chips off it is one less
//     coupling between the component tree and the workspace store.
//   - Server-side derivation would either require a per-PR enrichment query
//     (extra round-trip) or per-PR fields baked into the list response
//     (which already drifts via the lenient zod schema). Doing it on the
//     client keeps the contract minimal and the rules visible.
