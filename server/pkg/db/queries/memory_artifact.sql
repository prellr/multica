-- name: ListMemoryArtifacts :many
-- Default list path: workspace-scoped, optional kind / parent / tags
-- filters, archived hidden by default.
--
-- The narg-and-bool pattern (sqlc.arg + sqlc.narg) lets callers pass
-- "no filter" without coercing nil to a specific value. include_archived
-- defaults FALSE so paginated UI doesn't accidentally surface archived
-- rows after a redeploy.
--
-- Tags: when non-null, the filter uses the `&&` overlap operator so
-- the caller can pass either a single tag (matches rows that have it)
-- or several tags (matches rows that have at least one — OR semantics).
-- AND semantics across multiple tags would use `@>` but isn't needed
-- by current callers; revisit if a "must have all these tags" surface
-- shows up. The `tags` column has a GIN index from migration 068 so
-- this stays cheap at scale.
