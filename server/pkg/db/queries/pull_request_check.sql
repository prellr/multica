-- name: UpsertPullRequestCheck :one
-- Each (pr, head_sha, check name) folds to one row — the latest payload
-- wins. We bump updated_at so a debug query "what did GitHub say last"
-- has a sortable column.
--
-- ever_succeeded is sticky: it is true whenever the INCOMING conclusion
-- is 'success', and on conflict it stays true once true. This lets the
-- best-ever CI rollup (recomputeCIStatus) treat a check that passed once
-- as passing even if a later flaky rerun mutated its conclusion back to
-- a failure variant — PR7 of the Ship Hub rebuild.
